            I am 20 years young, residing at Rizal, Tagudin, Ilocos Sur. I Graduated as a STEM student from Tagudin National High School. Without any plan in my mind, I ended up attending ISPSC - Tagudin Campus for college, and I am currently taking up BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) as my chosen program.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose IT not because I was left no choice, but it was the safe path for me. Considering how fast technology evolves and how people are starting to be awfully reliant on the internet—I thought an IT diploma would be a good armor I could use in the future.

            When I’m not in front of my laptop, I spend time fulfilling my barangay duties, cycling, experimenting in the kitchen on whatever edible thing we have in the fridge, and—honestly—sleeping.
