          I am 20 years young, residing at Rizal, Tagudin, Ilocos Sur. I Graduated as a STEM student from Tagudin National High School. Without any plan in my mind, I ended up attending ISPSC - Tagudin Campus for college, and I am currently taking up BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) as my chosen program. I chose IT not because I was left no choice, but it was the safe path for me. Considering how fast technology evolves, and how people are starting to be awfully reliant on technologyâ€”specifically on the internetâ€”I thought that having an IT diploma would be a good armor I could use in the future.

          Other things that I do when I am not sticking my nose on the screen of my laptop are: doing my obligations in our barangay, riding my bike, experimenting on whatever food or edible things we have in the fridge, and sleeping.
